You duck your head towards the shed and grin as Lunchbox throws an empty beer can through the handle of the lawn mower. The motion makes it spin a little because you never drank beer until this summer and you haven’t quite hit your growth spurt yet like the older boys. 

You don’t look back over to her yard when Bobby says, “Hey, I think your girlfriend’s spying on us,” and the other guys snicker. You do make a disgusted face and yell back, “Yeah right, she wishes!” As you laugh, the memories of how you used to lay on the grass holding hands letting the afternoon sun warm your face as you watched airplanes form jetstreams and the one damp day all those Aprils back when when you were in the treehouse cupping a salamander she’d caught at the pond and you leaned over and kissed her on the lips and at first she looked at you like you had three heads, but then the tops of her cheeks started to turn pink and she smiled so you could just barely see that her front tooth was missing, they flash through your mind. They usually make you embarrassed but right now they make you a little sad for how things used to be, even though they weren’t that great then either. 

But you’re thirteen and these guys are cool and Scooty’s dad left them and Mikey’s dad beats his mom and your dad drank himself to death and they make you feel like you belong with them, and you want to belong with them. 

When Bobby tosses you a lighter and a pack of Pall Mall’s, you forget about how much you’ve hated the smell of cigarette smoke ever since that time you complained and rolled down a window when your dad was chain smoking in the car and he smacked you across the face because “it’s his damn car and he’ll do what he damn well pleases in it.” Bobby’s sitting on his skateboard. 


***Bobby, Evan, Lunchbox, and Scooty*** 

In hindsight, we shouldn’t have done it. Or made him do it, rather. Probably some of us knew it then and maybe some of us still don’t even know it.

***Mara***

She crouched down, careful not to hit her head on the roofbeam, and dusted off a little spot in the corner with her hand, scattering dust particles that shone as they hit the beams of afternoon sunlight streaming in from the window of the treehouse. She rubbed the dirt out from her hand out on the sides of her jean shorts before undoing the elastic of her little blue moleskine so they wouldn’t leave fingerprints on the clean, white pages. With a flourish, she pulled the pencil out from behind her ear and gave a quick lick to the tip before placing it to the paper, just like she imagined all serious writers did.

*August 16th, 2001*

*Today was okay. It’s too hot in the house and Simon is being annoying (as usual). I’m excited for school to start soon, but Mom said I have to wait for my birthday for the pierced ears so I won’t have them the first day.* 

She sighed. Writers didn’t just write about their boring days and their pesty little brothers, they needed something interesting to happen. She paused and looked around the tree house. It was smaller than she remembered it. She poked one eye out of the corner of the window and looked across the yard. Remy’s sandy hair was sticking out behind the back of the shed in his yard and the high school boys down the street were sitting in a group across from him, laughing and throwing cans through the handle of the lawnmower. One of them threw something silver to him that caught in the sunlight, but it was too small to make out. When he held it up, an almost imperceptible orange flame flickered up and down.
