***Charlie***

You duck your head towards the shed and grin as Lunchbox throws an empty beer can through the handle of the lawn mower. The motion makes it spin a little because you never drank beer until this summer and you haven’t quite hit your growth spurt yet like the older boys. 

You don’t look back over to her yard when Bobby says, “Hey, I think your girlfriend’s spying on us,” and the other guys snicker. You do make a disgusted face and yell back, “Yeah right, she wishes!” As you laugh, the memories of how you used to lay on the grass holding hands letting the afternoon sun warm your face as you watched airplanes form jetstreams and the one damp day all those Aprils back when when you were in the treehouse cupping a salamander she’d caught at the pond and you leaned over and kissed her on the lips and at first she looked at you like you had three heads, but then the tops of her cheeks started to turn pink and she smiled so you could just barely see that her front tooth was missing, they flash through your mind. They usually make you embarrassed but right now they make you a little sad for how things used to be, even though they weren’t that great then either. 

But you’re thirteen and these guys are cool and Scooty’s dad left them and Mikey’s dad beats his mom and your dad drank himself to death and they make you feel like you belong with them, and you want to belong with them. 

When Bobby tosses you a lighter and a pack of Pall Mall’s, you forget about how much you’ve hated the smell of cigarette smoke ever since that time you complained and rolled down a window when your dad was chain smoking in the car and he smacked you across the face because “it’s his damn car and he’ll do what he damn well pleases in it.” Bobby’s sitting on his skateboard. 


***Bobby, Evan, Lunchbox, and Scooty*** 

In hindsight, we shouldn’t have done it. Or made him do it, rather. Probably some of us knew it then and maybe some of us still don’t even know it.

***Mara***

Mara

She crouched down, careful not to hit her head on the roofbeam, and dusted off a little spot in the corner with her hand. The dust particles shone as they hit the beams of afternoon sunlight streaming in from the window. She sat down and looked around the treehouse. It had been almost a year since she sat in it and it seemed smaller than she remembered. She brushed aside a pile of dead leaves and absentmindedly traced her finger over an M + C next to a drawing of a hammer carved into the board. M for Mara and C for Charlie. For years “Can’t touch this” had been their passcode to enter, providing for endless torment of their little brothers who could never figure out the riddle, but it hadn’t been used for a while now. Charlie hadn’t come up here since the week after his dad’s funeral. They’d been carrying on like normal until she tried to tell him how sorry she was that his dad passed away and what a great guy he was. Like the flick of a switch, Charlie got uncharacteristically tough and said he was glad he was dead. She’d told him she thought that was a horrible thing to say about your own dad and he’d shouted that it was none of her business and stormed off. She couldn’t forget how empty his eyes looked. They had always understood each other from just a look, a power that had come in handy on more than a few occasions when they needed to corroborate a story for their parents or teachers. A few weeks later her dad saw him with Bobby Zavendale and his crew at the skate park and her parents told her she wasn’t allowed to hang out with him if they would be around. It turned out that he was always with them.

She sighed and undid the elastic of her little blue moleskine, taking care to rub the dirt from her hand off onto the sides of her jean shorts so they wouldn’t leave fingerprints on the pristine lined pages. With a flourish, she pulled the pencil out from behind her ear and gave a quick lick to the tip before placing it to the paper, just like she imagined all serious writers did.

*August 16th, 2001*

*Today was okay. It’s too hot in the house and Max is being annoying (as usual). I’m excited for school to start soon, but Mom said I have to wait for my birthday for the pierced ears so I won’t have them the first day.* 

The whoops and hollers from next door interrupted her reflection. She closed her notebook and poked one eye out of the corner of the window to look across the yard. Charlie’s sandy hair was sticking out behind the back of the shed in his yard and Bobby and the other guys were sitting in a group across from him, laughing and throwing cans through the handle of the lawnmower. She hated those boys and she hated Charlie most of all. For abandoning her, for getting trouble in school, for the time his mother called their house at midnight because she didn’t know where he was. When she was little and would say that her and Charlie were best friends forever, her mother would warn her that boys and girls always grew apart when they got older. But it wasn’t that they had grown apart, it was like she didn’t even know him anymore.   

She was trying to make out what they were saying when she locked eyes with Bobby as he was lighting his cigarette with a silver Zippo that was glinting in the sun. She quickly ducked her head out of the window and a sickly hot feeling began to radiate from the bottom of her stomach as she heard them laughing at her.

*I hate B.Z. and C.R. I hope Bobby chokes on his dumb cigarette.* 

She thought for a moment and erased it, replacing it with a row of little flowers so you could just barely make out the words that had been underneath, and only if you were looking for them. She didn’t want Bobby Zavendale’s name to ruin the sanctity of her journal.

As she was putting the elastic back on, she heard an explosion and stuck her head out of the window to see a burst of flames shooting out from the entryway of the shed. The boys had all jumped back, standing frozen, and Charlie was laying on the ground. The same hot, sickly feeling washed over her and she raced down the steps, tossing her journal aside in the dirt below so she could run faster.

When she got to him, some of the guys were trying to shake him awake and she pushed them out of the way.

“Charlie! Charlie!”

Slowly, his eyelids slowly raised and fell shut again. She took his hand and he gave a feeble squeeze. Even though their eyes only met for a second, she felt like she knew.
