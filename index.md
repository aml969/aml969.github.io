### About this project 

<p>For this portfolio, I wanted to create an engaging experience for the reader. Part of my job includes computer programming and I wanted to see if I could incorporate that into the creative writing process. The result ended up being a fairly barebones website, a minimal e-book, and a dummy scrollytelling site that I ended up scrapping but at least built a working framework for. Creating a portfolio in this way would serve a few main purposes: as I mentioned, I think it creates a more engaging experience for the user; it has room to grow and would be easy to makde edits and/or build onto in the future; it allowed me to learn a new skill that would be somewhat relevant to my work, and it serves as a possible way for someone like me who wouldnâ€™t ordinarily have the opportunity to have their writing published to self-publish at no cost. The result is two short stories that mix realism and absurdity to create, a peculiar reality.</p>
