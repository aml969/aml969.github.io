## Scenes from Coal Crick Road, 400 Block
 
***Summer***

 Rigby squinted through the streaks of sunlight streaming down from the clouds. They warmed her tiny 
scraped knees as she laid against the damp earth not quite yet dry from the previous night’s thunderstorm. 
The stiff blades of grass angrily poked her back through her faded t-shirt to let her know they wanted to 
feel the warmth of the sun, too. She had been there all afternoon, making pictures out of the clouds and watching 
jet streams form as the occasional airplane flew high overhead. One day she thought she would like to ride in an
airplane and fly through a cloud so it would look like she was floating in a puffy mound of cotton candy. She 
imagined people looking out the windows smiling down at her having fun playing in her yard, thinking she would 
look like the size of a little ant to them, unaware they couldn’t see her any better than they could a speck of 
dust in a mound of dirt. Her hands clasped behind her mussed ponytail and she closed her eyes, wishing she could 
stay there forever. Thump. The familiar sting of a playground ball hit her legs. She sprung up and hurled it as 
hard as she could towards the swing her brother was standing on, trying to keep his balance. 

“Alder! Quit it, you big dummy!”

Alder jumped off of the swing and kicked the ball back over at her. “I’m booored,” he complained in a dull, drawn out voice.
She made a face at him. She couldn’t understand why he was always complaining he was bored. Only boring people got bored, 
as her grandmother would tell them. She loved catching salamanders and toads at the big mud puddle in the woods behind her 
house in the spring and chasing lightning bugs barefoot in the grass on warm mid-summer nights. And she never grew tired 
of riding bikes up and down the street with Remy, her sun-bleached hair tangling in the wind. They would return home at 
dusk sweaty under a layer of dust from the hard dirt road and feeling the sharp ache of new bruises forming, the result 
of hitting their shins on the pedals, proof of a day well played. She could never feel bored stretched out under that 
neverending sky. She thought when she got older she would like to live here in a house just like hers so her little kids 
could ride their bikes up and down the street and catch salamanders, too. Maybe she would marry Remy. And they would get 
a little puppy. They both wanted one, but their moms said no. 

A soft, warm breeze emanating from the direction of the neighbor’s house filled her nose with an intoxicating mix of 
charcoal and green earth. She turned and peered over to the yard to see if he was playing outside. At first she 
didn’t see him, but then she caught a bright flash of a red t-shirt between the green and browns of the wooded edge. 

“Remy!” she sat up and called over to the edge of his backyard, “Wanna ride bikes?”

“We’re eating dinner soon. My dad’s grilling steaks,” he shouted back.

“We can ride just for a little bit!”

“Okay, lemme get mine.” Remy tossed his stick aside and poked his sandy hair out from behind a tree, unsteadily climbing 
over the rocks and brush in the direction of his garage. A muffled voice yelled after him to be back in twenty minutes.
 
***Autumn*** 

Eddie stretched his back and swung around his stool to warm his hands on the space heater beneath his workbench. The older 
he got, the more he could feel his hands growing stiff in the cold weather. It made him wonder how many good years of manual 
labor he had left in him. He hoped it was a few, because it was pretty much all he had. And he did like the work. He liked 
being his own boss and working his own hours and the fact that he didn’t have to pay much in taxes because he got paid under 
the table. But if he was honest, the thing he liked the most was spending a chilly autumn day in the garage he built with 
his own grease-stained hands, the sun streaming in through the dusty windows to dry the dampness in the air. He’d purposely 
placed the windows so the one by his workbench directly faced the red maple tree on the edge of his yard. He liked the way 
its leaves were always changing, but in a way he could always depend on, in a cycle. What goes around comes around, that was 
what his dad always told him when the seasons started to change. Eddie always laughed at him insisting that wasn’t what the 
saying meant, but in the years since he had passed, Eddie would find himself reciting it as he saw the first leaves turn. 

He frowned at Jimmy Gresh’s old teal pick-up truck in the middle of the garage. He’d finished putting on the snow tires like 
Jimmy had asked, but the thing was a rusty piece of shit. Like car, like owner, he thought. His family had known the Greshes 
for years and he never felt such a sour taste in his mouth for any of them as he did Jimmy, though the old man could be a real 
piece of work, too. Being his neighbor had only worsened his disdain; everything Jimmy had but he didn’t was on constant 
display. A beautiful wife, two kids-a boy and a girl, a college degree, and some white collar job a county over-one that 
should afford him a better truck than that one, as a matter of fact. Eddie always got the feeling he was hiding his true 
personality underneath all the bullshit. He would secretly roll his eyes from the end of the bar every time Jimmy came in 
spewing religious and political ideology that was no more his than some professor’s from a decade and a half ago, but Eddie 
always managed to keep it cordial. You couldn’t afford to make enemies when you owned a business in a small town. Luckily, 
like a lot of people with book smarts, Eddie thought, Jimmy didn’t know a lick about fixing cars, and he was happy to give 
him a special neighborly discount. Used parts, extra billed hours, made up repairs- seeing how much he could get away with 
with his customers amused him to no end and it wasn’t too shabby in providing him extra gambling money, either. Today he’d 
decided the time was as good as any to replace Jimmy’s brake pads with some used ones he had laying around. 

He sat down to make out the bill, thinking about any last minute “repairs” he could tack on when he got distracted by the 
sound of the school bus pulling up, reminding him he was late for Evelyn. He had told her he would pick up her medications 
and some groceries at three o’clock, which was at least an hour ago by now. There’d probably be three messages on his machine 
when he got home asking where he was. His friends didn’t know why he put up with her, but the truth is he had a bit of a 
soft spot for the old lady and he knew she needed him, which was more than he could say for anyone else. He flung open the 
door and looked over through the thinning treeline to see if Evelyn was watching out of her front window for him. Sure enough, 
practically Old Faithful herself, she was sitting there looking as if she had been sucking on a lemon all afternoon. Luckily, 
her glare was directed to the kids playing kickball on the street.

Eddie saw the ball heading toward his window and swung around the side of the garage before he even heard it crack. They 
both looked spooked, maybe by his dirty coveralls and scowl, but probably by the fact they saw him out. The girl ran away 
over to her yard and the boy was trying to shrink behind the maple.

“Get over here! Ya cracked my window. There’s plenty of room for playing ball on your side of the street.”

“Sorry, Mr. Zapsky we didn’t mean to. Please don’t tell my parents. I can help you fix it.”

“Where’s your friend? I seen the both of you were playing out here.”

The boy’s lip was trembling. “No, no, it was my fault. I kicked it too hard and it went crooked and she couldn’t catch it. 
I’m really sorry.”

Eddie inspected the crack, running his finger down the pane. It wasn’t too bad and he could probably patch it up pretty 
easily with some glass adhesive. It’d put a big splinter down the trunk of his maple tree, though. He caught a glimpse of 
Jimmy in the kid’s big, round eyes staring up at him and sighed. He couldn’t do it to the poor kid. “Well it ain’t shattered 
at least.”  

“We’re sorry, we won’t do it again.”

“Alright, don’t cry. I’ll see about it. I won’t tell your dad. Just go play in your own yards. And tell your dad his truck 
is ready. I won’t say nothing about the window.”

Eddie went back inside and sat down at his workbench. He looked through the cracked glass out to his tree, and hearing his 
dad’s voice, penciled in a new entry on the bill.

***Winter***

Evelyn Surcovick sat perched in front of her big bay window, her thinning frame engulfed by the tattered floral bergère. 
She frowned at the gleeful shouts of the neighbor children coming up and down the hill, the sounds of their plastic sleds 
grinding against the gravel at the bottom. Practically every day those two were out there causing a ruckus from the time 
the school bus pulled away until dinnertime, and it was enough to qualify as disturbing the peace in her opinion. When her 
kids were young, they would have been shoveling the walks of their neighbors instead of terrorizing them with all the awful 
noise. She hoped her grandkids down in North Carolina had more respect for their lonely elderly neighbors than these kids.

She sat back and reflected on her day. It had one of her most productive in a long while, especially for the winter when 
everyone seemed to retreat to their houses, leaving the streets empty and grey. In the morning, she had watched her neighbor, 
Gloria’s, Yorkshire terrier run the whole way across the street to chew the pant leg of the mailman while she had her toast 
and coffee. The dog didn’t let go until the mailman sent it flying with a hard shake of his leg, a strip of blue fabric 
hanging from the pooch’s teeth and all. Good riddance to both of them, she thought. That terrier was a nasty little thing 
that Gloria paraded around with a red bow in its hair allowing it to relieve itself all over her flower bed in the spring 
and the mailman had been on her list ever since he dropped a birthday card from her grandkids in a puddle last month. Then, 
after she had had her tuna sandwich, she witnessed not one, but two of the church ladies sneak trays of food out to their 
cars while they were setting up for bingo night. She had made a mental note to thank them for volunteering and giving so 
much to the church on Sunday. Best of all, in the afternoon, Gloria’s nephew had gone to pick up his car at Eddie’s and 
argued with him in the driveway for a good fifteen minutes over the bill before peeling out so aggressively that he slid 
a few feet on a patch of ice, just narrowly missing the mailboxes. Gloria was always telling her Eddie was a cheat and 
Evelyn knew she was probably right. Still, even though she didn’t like to admit it, she held a soft spot for him as he’d 
grown up with her oldest boy. Tomorrow she would have to see if she could get the whole story between phoning Gloria and 
poking Eddie when he came over to drop her groceries for the week. If he didn’t forget again, that is. Yes, after all of 
that excitement, she deserved some peace and quiet.

The shouts were getting closer to her house now and she strained through the dim light to just barely make out a pair of 
tiny figures, one with a wild mess of blonde hair poking out beneath a pink knit toboggan hat. She never understood why 
the Donahue girl’s mother let her run wild like she did with her hair unbrushed, wearing mismatched clothes, always digging 
around in the dirt or racing those bikes up and down the street with Jimmy Gresh’s boy. And their names were dreadful, the lot 
of them. What kind of name was Rigby? Then the littlest one, what was it? Clementine... Sage... no, Olive. Olive and Alder. 
Their nursery may as well have been filled with trees instead of children. 

She looked down her nose as they trudged up to her porch, weighed down by their snow gear and leaving behind a mess of boot 
prints in her front yard, and knocked on the window with their tiny mittened fists. She didn’t know what they wanted, but it 
was surely an invasion of her privacy. 

“Mrs. Surcovick, can me and Remy shovel your walk for you?” Rigby shouted through the glass, her cheeks rosy from the cold. 
With her face so close to hers through the frosted pane, in the glow of the streetlight, she was almost taken aback by how 
much her smile resembled her granddaughter’s.

“Don’t scrape the paint on the porch steps.” By the end of the sentence, even she regretted saying it.

“We won’t!” The boy leaped off the porch, grabbing his shovel.

Just as she started to pull on the drapes, they paused flinging the shovefuls of snow to look back and wave. She picked up 
her bony, wrinkled hand and waved back, a polite smile poking through her lips. Maybe she could leave them open a while.

***Spring***
 
Remy jumped off the bus, tilting his chin upwards and craning his neck up the road to see if he could spot his dad. He usually 
came to the bus stop to walk Remy home, but was nowhere to be seen. At almost-nine-years-old he thought he was too old for his 
dad to walk him. Rigby’s mom didn’t pick her up. She said Alder was big enough to walk Rigby and Ollie home, but it didn’t 
really matter anyway because he usually just ran ahead of them or straggled behind playing with his friends from the next 
street over. Remy wrinkled his nose trying to picture where his mom told him the spare key was hidden, but he couldn’t 
remember.

They walked up the hill past the last little patches of crusty white snow flecked with dirt, their winter coats flapping open 
to soak in as many sun rays as possible. The snow would be gone by next week, leaving a muddy brown landscape until the buds 
on the trees came out of hiding, sure they were safe from any final frosts, and the little green blades of grass were strong 
enough to poke their dewy heads through the cool, moist earth. By the time they got to Rigby’s house, Remy could see the 
rusted teal blue bed of his dad’s pick-up truck in the driveway through a gap in the bushes and breathed a sigh of relief 
that someone was home. When he opened the door, the only thing he could hear was the television. He walked through the kitchen 
to the living room to see his dad sprawled out on the Lazy Boy and his two-year-old sister, Noah, in front of the television 
playing quietly in the middle of a pile of her toys. He shrugged his coat and backpack off on the floor by the couch and 
tiptoed into the kitchen in search of leftover candy from last month’s Valentine’s exchange at school. He found one of the 
forgotten dollar store red heart-shaped lollipops at the bottom of the bin and carefully pulled off the wrapper so it 
wouldn’t crinkle, taking care to shove it far down to the bottom of the trash can to erase all evidence of him sneaking candy 
after school. He tiptoed back to the couch and laid down stretching his legs out across the cushions. He switched the channel 
from baby cartoons to big kids’ cartoons and sat there enthralled, sucking his lollipop and wiggling his big toe through the 
little hole on the top of his sock, occasionally covering his mouth with his arm to stifle his laughs.

When the show went to commercial, the volume got louder and he noticed his dad stir. He froze for a second then lowered the 
volume, changed the channel to one his dad liked, and silently scampered up the stairs to his bedroom being sure to turn the 
knob as he shut the door so it wouldn’t click shut. 

He jumped on his bed laying upside down so his feet were propped up on his pillow. This was an extremely fun and refreshing 
way to lay on a bed, as he had decided. He looked out the window at a bird sitting among the spidery bare tree branches in 
the yard. He looked up at the swirl patterns on his ceiling. He looked at the Star Wars characters on his comforter. He wished 
he had a television in his bedroom. He ran his finger over a painting he had done in art class, the paper stiff and wrinkled 
from the watercolor, admiring his handiwork on the blossoming cherry tree emerging from the left. He heard the groan of the 
Lazy Boy, then the creak of floorboards in the living room, then the thud of footsteps on the stairs. He could always tell 
people apart by their footsteps. He considered he might have some type of superpower, kind of like telepathy. Before his mom 
or dad even got in the house, he could tell which one of them it was just from the way their feet sounded on the porch steps 
and how they stuck their keys in the door. His dad opened his bedroom door with a little push. Remy had locked it, but the 
lock had been busted from being forced so many times it was now purely symbolic. 

“When did you get home?”

Remy didn’t look up from his painting. “When the bus came.”

His dad walked across the room and leaned down so close to Remy’s ear that his nose involuntarily wrinkled at the familiar 
mixture of stale cigarette smoke, beer, and unwashed clothes. “Don’t be a smart ass. And you look at me when I’m talking to 
you.” 

Remy flinched as little specks of spit sprayed onto his ear and his dad swatted the paper out of his hands. It flew to the floor, crumpling the left side. He listened for his dad to walk back down the stairs, slam the door, and pull out of the driveway. Then he rolled off of his bed, went back downstairs, changed the channel back to cartoons, and sat on the floor playing blocks with Noah.

***

Remy rubbed his eyes, gradually gaining consciousness, awoken by the sound of yelling. He had grown to be a heavy sleeper, 
but the banging and arguing coming from his parents’ room had elevated. His dad had been yelling off and on ever since Remy 
had heard him drive up the driveway from his bedroom as he was trying to fall asleep. As soon as he heard the first shout, 
he had gotten out of bed, taken all his books off the shelf of his nightstand, lugged it across his room to lay it across 
the doorjamb, and returned the books to their shelf. He crawled back in bed amused by his clever little barricade and proud 
that he had been strong enough to move it all by himself. Now half-asleep, he dumped the shelf once again and pushed the 
nightstand aside so he could squeeze through the gap in the door. Across the hall, he could see his dad standing over his 
mom with a hand on her neck screaming and swatting at her, her screaming back at him, both illuminated by the moonlight 
streaming through the cracks in the blinds. He ran over and started to hit the side of his dad’s gut, but his dad reached 
over, picked him up by his shirt, and threw him down to the floor, his shoulder bone making contact with the hard wood of 
their dresser on the way down. His mom shouted at him to go back to his room, so he rubbed the sting off his shoulder, 
scurried back across the wall, and curled up under his comforter, his heart fluttering. A few minutes later, he had almost 
fallen back asleep when a bright light cut through his eyelids as it flicked on overhead. His mom stood in his doorframe, 
his sister sleeping in her arms.

“Rem, get your stuff on. We’re gonna go in the car.”

“No, I wanna stay here and sleep in my bed,” he mumbled through closed eyes.

“Get your coat,” she hissed back. “No, don’t change your clothes. Just put it on over your pajamas.”

Eyelids heavy, he grabbed his coat and shoes, and climbed in the backseat of the car. They drove to the parking lot of the 
church down the street and sat there, enveloped in the quiet darkness. Remy unbuckled his seatbelt and tried to stretch out 
across the seats best as he could, his knees pushed up against Noah’s carseat. He balled up part of the blanket his mom kept 
in the trunk against the door as a pillow and snuggled up in the rest. It would have been cozy if he hadn’t forgotten socks. 
It made his bare feet feel cold and gross against the worn out insoles of his play sneakers. His mom was asleep in the front 
seat, the book she kept in the glove compartment fanned out across her chest. He saw headlights approaching through the 
reflection in the window and tilted his chin up, craning his neck to see the black and white of a police car approaching. 

“Mom,” he whispered, nudging her awake.

His mom rolled down the window, letting in a gust of cold night air.

The cop peered through the window, “What’s going on here?”

“My husband was drunk and yelling, and so I wanted a place to take the kids for a bit.”

“Okay. Well you can’t park in this lot.”

“It was just for a little bit so we could get out of the house.”

“Do you want to make a report?”
 
“No.”

“Okay, then you need to leave. I don’t care if you go home or not, but you can’t stay out here.”

His mom rolled up the window, whispered “asshole” under her breath as she put the key in the ignition, and drove away. 
When they got back to the house, everything was still and quiet. His dad was passed out on the Lazy Boy again, snoring. 
Remy’s stomach rumbled under the assumption it was morning, he had been awake for so long.

“Mom, can I have a snack?” he whispered.

“No, go upstairs to bed. You have to wake up in a couple hours for school. Good night,” she whispered back. She carried 
Noah up to her room. She had slept through the whole thing. Remy peeled off his sneakers, shrugged out of his coat, and 
sleepily trudged up the stairs. He hopped into bed and cocooned into his comforter grinning from ear to ear as his head 
hit his pillow because it felt so comfy. A few minutes later he was asleep.
